<h1>Attack on Lord Ruler</h1>
          <h2>Atium</h2>
          <p>Atium was a very powerful metal on the allomatic table. The Lord Ruler had much of this, and the crew Kelsier organized was just the right fit for the job of stealing it. 
            Kelsier had been sent to the Pits being forced by Lord Ruler to mine for the atium. He didn't want anyone to know about the mine, so he let no one escape. Kelsier was an exception; he had been able to sneak out and had been seeking revenge ever since.</p>
          <h2>Timing</h2>
<p>The attack was to be made in a year, and until then, Kelsier's brother Marsh would work as a spy for information.</p>
<h2>Weapons</h2>   
          <p>Kelsier did whatever it took. </p>
