<li>Research</li>
<li>Classes/courses</li>
<li>Shopping</li>
</ul>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>Chrome is a search engine, not a site; for it knows nothing. The only thing it knows is how to do it's job. When you type something into the search box, and it presents you with links to go to websites. Any information on the right hand side it presents to you is from those websites anyway. </p>
<h3>Classes/courses</h3>
<p>Chrome isn't a place you can go to take classes, but it is a place to go to sign up for classes. Say you want to take online classes at BYU. You can sign up through Chrome and then continue on you goal.</p>
<h3>Shopping</h3>
<p>The H-E-B Curbside is one way many people shop online. When you go to the website you choose whether you want to go there to pick up the groceries you select or have them delivered to your house. Then as you keep going, you can select the item(s) you would like to purchase.</p>
